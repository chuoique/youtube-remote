A nodejs based screen and remote app to play youtube videos. When configured correctly the screen page(index.html) can be controlled through the remote page(remote.html). The app used socket.io to communicate so both screen and remote pages can be loaded on any browser with proper javascript support and then the screen can be controlled from the remote.
